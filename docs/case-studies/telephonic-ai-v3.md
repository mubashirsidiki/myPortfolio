<h2 style="color: white;">How AI Powers the System</h2>

<strong>AI is the heart of Telephonic AI V3. Here’s how it works:</strong>

- <strong>Real-Time Conversation:</strong> The AI backend connects directly to OpenAI’s GPT-4o via WebSocket, enabling live, dynamic conversations with callers.
- <strong>Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech:</strong> Handles both audio and text input, transcribes calls, and generates natural-sounding responses.
- <strong>Scenario Management:</strong> Dynamically adjusts prompts and conversation flows based on business logic, agent settings, and user input.
- <strong>Session Management:</strong> Manages timeouts, end-call scenarios, and error handling (including rate limits and retries).
- <strong>Integration:</strong> The AI backend acts as a bridge between Twilio (telephony) and OpenAI (AI), orchestrating the entire call experience.

<strong>AI Challenges & Solutions:</strong>
- <strong>Latency:</strong> Optimized WebSocket handling and prompt management for real-time performance.
- <strong>Error Handling:</strong> Robust retry logic and validation for OpenAI responses.
- <strong>Customization:</strong> Modular prompt and scenario management for different business needs.

<h2 style="color: white;">Technical Breakdown</h2>

<strong>Database & Storage:</strong>
- <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> via MikroORM for structured data (users, agents, calls, analytics).
- <strong>Session and call data</strong> managed in-memory and persisted as needed.

<strong>Backend Architecture:</strong>
- <strong>NestJS</strong> microservices structure, with modules for users, agents, analytics, permissions, notifications, and more.
- <strong>RESTful APIs</strong> for frontend and service integrations.
- <strong>Swagger/OpenAPI</strong> for API documentation and testing.

<strong>AI Backend:</strong>
- <strong>FastAPI</strong> app with modular routes for agent onboarding, Twilio integration, and log viewing.
- <strong>OpenAI integration</strong> via async WebSocket for real-time AI.
- <strong>Utility modules</strong> for logging, error handling, and prompt management.

<strong>Key API Routes:</strong>
- <code>/ai/session</code> (WebSocket): Real-time AI session for calls
- <code>/ai/socket/incoming-call</code>: Handles Twilio inbound calls
- <code>/ai/socket/outgoing-call</code>: Handles Twilio outbound calls

<strong>Engineering Decisions:</strong>
- <strong>Separation of concerns:</strong> Isolated AI, backend, frontend, and observability services.
- <strong>Containerization:</strong> Docker for consistent, scalable deployment.
- <strong>Observability:</strong> Grafana stack for logs and monitoring.

<h2 style="color: white;">User Journey Walkthrough</h2>

<strong>Step 1: User Initiates a Call</strong>
- The user (customer or agent) dials in via the web dialer or phone.
- The frontend triggers a call event, routed through Twilio.

<strong>Step 2: Backend Orchestration</strong>
- The backend receives the call event, authenticates the user, and determines the appropriate agent or AI flow.
- Relevant session and agent data are fetched from the database.

<strong>Step 3: AI Session Begins</strong>
- The backend signals the AI backend to start a real-time session.
- The AI backend establishes a WebSocket connection with OpenAI, sets up prompts, and manages session state.

<strong>Step 4: Real-Time Conversation</strong>
- The user speaks or types; audio/text is streamed to the AI backend.
- The AI backend transcribes audio, processes input, and generates responses using GPT-4o.
- Responses are sent back to the user in real time (via Twilio or the web dialer).

<strong>Step 5: Analytics & Logging</strong>
- All interactions are logged and analyzed.
- The admin dashboard displays real-time analytics, call transcripts, and agent performance.

<strong>Step 6: Monitoring & Observability</strong>
- Logs from all services are aggregated and visualized in Grafana.
- Admins can view system health, errors, and call logs in real time.
