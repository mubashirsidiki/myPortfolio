Key features include:
- AI chat and content review
- Job data aggregation and analysis
- Multi-platform access (web, mobile, extension)
- Secure, scalable cloud-native deployment

## Tech Stack {style="color: white;"}

**Frontend:**

- Expo (React Native) for mobile  
- Vite + React for browser extension

**Backend:**  
- NestJS (Node.js, TypeScript) REST API  
- Fastify for high-performance HTTP handling  
- Prisma ORM for database access  
- Redis for caching and queues  
- Sentry for error monitoring

**Database:**  
- PostgreSQL (via Prisma ORM)

**Infrastructure / DevOps:**  
- Docker & Docker Compose for local development  
- Helm & Kubernetes for cloud deployment  
- GCloud Registry, S3 for storage  
- Makefile for build automation

**AI/ML Tools and Frameworks:**  
- FastAPI (Python) for AI microservices  
- HuggingFace Transformers for NLP  
- OpenAI API for advanced language models  
- Custom fine-tuned models  
- Uvicorn for ASGI server

## How AI Powers the System {style="color: white;"}

AI is the heart of Mind Orbi, enabling features that go far beyond simple automation:

- **Role:** AI handles chat, content analysis, language detection, voice/text analysis, and job data enrichment.
- **Models Used:**  
  - HuggingFace models for NLP tasks  
  - OpenAI (e.g., GPT-4) for advanced language understanding  
  - Custom fine-tuned models for domain-specific tasks
- **Integration:**  
  - AI services are exposed via FastAPI endpoints  
  - The backend communicates with AI via REST APIs  
  - Models are loaded and managed in a modular, scalable way
- **AI Tasks:**  
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
  - Classification and summarization  
  - Language and voice detection  
  - Real-time chat and content review
- **Challenges & Solutions:**  
  - **Challenge:** Managing large models and fast inference  
    **Solution:** Local caching, HuggingFace cache management, and efficient API design  
  - **Challenge:** Secure, scalable deployment  
    **Solution:** Containerization, cloud storage, and robust API authentication

## Technical Breakdown {style="color: white;"}

- **Database:**  
  - PostgreSQL, managed via Prisma ORM  
  - Stores user data, chat history, job listings, and AI analysis results
- **Backend Architecture:**  
  - Modular NestJS app with feature-based modules (auth, users, jobs, AI, etc.)  
  - RESTful APIs, with Swagger and Redoc for documentation  
  - Redis for caching and background jobs (BullMQ)
- **AI Service:**  
  - FastAPI app, modular endpoints for each AI task  
  - HuggingFace and OpenAI integration  
  - Handles SSL, environment config, and model caching
- **Engineering Decisions:**  
  - Microservices for scalability  
  - Docker/Helm for reproducible deployments  
  - Type safety and code quality via TypeScript and ESLint
- **Key API Routes:**  
  - `/api/chat` — AI chat endpoint  
  - `/api/jobs` — Job search and analysis  
  - `/api/analysis` — Content and voice/text analysis  
  - `/api/auth` — Authentication and user management

## User Journey Walkthrough {style="color: white;"}

1. **User visits the web app, mobile app, or opens the browser extension.**
2. **They log in or sign up, then access the main dashboard.**
3. **User initiates an action (e.g., starts a chat, searches for jobs, uploads content for analysis).**
4. **Frontend sends a request to the backend API.**
5. **Backend authenticates the user and routes the request:**
   - For chat or analysis, backend calls the AI FastAPI service.
   - For job search, backend may trigger the job scraper microservice.
6. **AI service processes the request:**
   - Loads the appropriate model (HuggingFace, OpenAI, or custom)
   - Runs NLP, classification, summarization, or analysis
   - Stores results in the database if needed
7. **Backend receives AI results, applies any business logic, and returns the response to the frontend.**
8. **User sees the result in real time—AI-generated content, analysis, or job insights.**
9. **User can interact further, with each action triggering the same seamless flow.**
